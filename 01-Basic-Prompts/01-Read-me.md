# Read Me - Intro
  

 ## Welcome
######
Welcome to the basic section of the Laser Coaching curriculum. Here you will refresh and hone skills requiring accurate, precise knowledge of the basic building blocks of Javascript. Through prompts challenging you on a variety of topics, from accessing data structures to complex looping mechanisms, you will level up both problem solving ability and coding syntax knowledge. 
######
Most problems lie in the beginner category. However, as you progress through a unit, you are likely to find difficulty and complexity increase to a level expected of an intermediate level. Similarly, the difficult of each successive unit tends to increase.
For best results, follow your coach's instructions on where to focus your practice. 
######


## Expectations

By practicing the problems in this section, you will gain or review the following:
######
* *Accuracy in accessing data structures*
* *Deep understanding of mutability and immutability*
* *Improved debugging skills and awareness*
* *Insight into javascript flow of execution*
* *Further understanding of loops and iterations*
* *Greater problem solving skills*


## Scope of Sections

Each section connects with the others. The titles are not comprehensive to the content contained within each problem set. For example, 'Objects' will have problems that test and require understanding of arrays and strings, not just objects. 
######
The focus remains fundamental throughout, with a focus on basic problem solving and beginner JS skills. However, the difficulty generally grows each lesson as the student journeys deeper into the given prompts. By the end of the lessons, the student can expect to face harder questions challenging their problem solving skills.

## How To Study

Any instructions provided by your laser coach trump any instructions written here. As the student of a coach you should follow their direction. The below are meant as general prescriptions to either remind of or strengthen the advice given by a coach.
######
To benefit most from these prompts, it is important to follow a practice pattern that ensures you will perform well and efficiently under pressure.
######
Here are some recommendations:
######
* *Give yourself time pressure. Set a clock for 20 minutes.*
* *Stop when you run out of time.*
* *If you did not solve the problem in the time limit, try again from scratch 24-48 hours later.*
* *Give yourself plenty of time to comprehend, understand, and plan for a prompt. 5 - 10 minutes is normal!*
* *Practice the style of explaining you plan on using on your TAA while solving the prompts.*
* *Review what you did well.* 
* *Reflect on where you might have wasted time.*
* *Reflect on your performance and progress. Consider how to improve.*
* *Take your coach's advice.*


### Time for some problems! Good luck!
